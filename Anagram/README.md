A program that finds anagrams based on user form input, April 24, 2018. By Kristi Hwang

##Description
This webpage will contain a form where an user is directed to input several words to check for anagrams.  The first word entered will be the marker against which all latter words will be checked against. Once the form is submitted with a minimum of three words, the results will display accordingly.  If the word is not an anagram, it will display "That is not an anagram". If the word is an anagram, it will display "you have successfully found your anagram!"

##Specs
  _Recognize the first word as the anagram word._
  _Make sure all characters in the anagram word are present in the latter words._
  _Check the occurrence of every character present in the anagram word._
  _Compare the occurrence of every character in the anagram word to the occurrence of characters in the latter words._
  _Recognize an anagram match if latter words contain all the characters present in the anagram word._
